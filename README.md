# michibot
Repository for my discord bot

it can:
  - write michi with a random emoji in the michi channel
  - randomly ping a user in the server (every 30 min to 24h)
  - count up in the "zhaeln" channel (credit to CharlesLegrerg for the spelling)
  - add a random reaction to each message of a specific user in michi channel
  - add a random reaction to each user with the bot role
  
NOTE: i did not test when roles, userid or channel names don't exist
